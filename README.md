# NetBeans Assign Statements Aligner / Beautifier

#### _A Simple NetBeans Plug-in for formatting assignment Statements for better readability_

Created as part of working on other projects. I found it very unpleasant to look at the codes where assignments are not in a straight guide
and I can't easily understand my own code. So started on working this. Had a lot of help from Microsoft Co-Pilot.

Just make the code more readable I needed to type a lot of space keys or tab keys. for 10 lines that OK. but for 10s or lines or hundreds of it throughout the project, I needed an automation.
Hope this simple tool helps you too! Happy Coding!!!
